# Recommender-systems

A recommendation system is an artificial intelligence or AI algorithm, usually associated with **machine learning**, that uses Big Data to suggest or recommend additional products to consumers. These can be based on various criteria, including past purchases, search history, demographic information, and other factors. Recommender systems are highly useful as they help users discover products and services they might otherwise have not found on their own. Indeed, the goal of a recommender system is to generate meaningful recommendations to a collection of users for items or products that might interest them.


There are two main types of recommender systems – personalized and non-personalized. 

▶**Non-personalized recommendation systems** like popularity based recommenders recommend the most popular items to the users, for instance top-10 movies, top selling books, the most frequently purchased products. 


▶**Personalized recommender systems** analyze users data, their purchases, rating and their relationships with other users in more detail. In that way every user will get customized recommendations.

       ➡ The most popular types of personalized recommendation systems are content based and collaborative filtering
